Loki Quick Start
------------------------
deps: Django 1.0, createrepo, sqlite, python-ldap (or other db)

1: if you're using a different db engine update example_project/settings.py

2: in project dir run ./manage.py syncdb --noinput 

3a: in project dir run ./manage.py runserver
connect to http://localhost:8000/admin
or
3b: in project dir run ./manage.py twistd
connect to http://localhost:8001/admin

4: http://localhost:8000/import/steps/

5: http://localhost:8000/import/status/

6: use admin to create master and slaves

7: use root of site to stop and start bots and
   add steps to slaves

NOTE: when you add steps to the slaves you have to
go into the admin and save the master for the configs to
be generated and written to disk. In the future this will
be less painful.
